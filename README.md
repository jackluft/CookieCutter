Welcome to the Cookie Cuuter API project
----------------------------------------
This project will let you create a API with one command!
Before you begin make sure that you have cookiecutter installed. You can install cookiecutter with
pip or following the tutorial: https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html
To create a API with a fully working database, enter the command: "cookiecutter ChristmasCookieCutter".
This will prompt you for "repo_name[API-Service]:" This will be the directoy name for the API.
After you have executed the command above, navigate to the cookiecutter directory, that you named and follow the README file in it.
