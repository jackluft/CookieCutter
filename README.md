Welcome to the Cookie Cuuter API project
----------------------------------------
This project will let you create a API with one command!
Before you begin make sure that you have cookiecutter installed. You can install cookiecutter with
pip or following the tutorial: https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html
To create a API with a fully working database, enter the command: "cookiecutter ChristmasCookieCutter".
This will prompt you for you for the directroy name, for the project and the databasae and apit configuration details. 
By pressing enter you will set the default values. Example is below:

$: CookieCutter % cookiecutter CookieCutter

repo_name [Cookie-Directory]: Temp

postgres_user [postgres]:

postgres_password [postgres]:

postgres_db [jacktable]:

postgres_port [5432]:

api_port [80]:

In this exmaple I set the directory Name to "Temp"
and the the postgres database settings to the default values, which are showen in the square backets []
